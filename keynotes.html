                            Bell Labs in the 1970s was a hotbed of research in computing,
                            statistics and many other fields.  The conditions there
                            encouraged the growth of the S language and influenced its content.
                            The 40th anniversary of S is an appropriate time to relate a personal
                            view of that scene and reflect on why S (and R) turned out as it did.

                            The speaker will discuss what he considers to be the most important
                            outcome of his work developing TeX in the 1980s, namely the accidental
                            discovery of a new approach to programming --- which caused a radical change
                            in his own coding style. Ever since then, he has aimed to write programs
                            for human beings (not computers) to read. The result is that the programs
                            have fewer mistakes, they are easier to modify and maintain, and they
                            can indeed be understood by human beings. This facilitates reproducible
                            research, among other things.

                            The intuition and experience needed for sound statistics
                            practice can be hard to learn, and a course that combines computing,
                            statistics, and working with data offers an excellent learning
                            environment in this regard. Moreover, an integrated approach to data
                            science creates opportunities to reinforce statistical thinking skills
                            throughout the full data analysis cycle, from data acquisition and
                            cleaning to data organization and analysis to communicating
                            results. As a result, students gain the ability to reason
                            computationally, actively engage in statistical problem solving, and
                            learn how to keep abreast of new technologies as they evolve. This
                            talk describes approaches and provides examples for teaching data
                            science in this integrated fashion.

                            Analyzing Big Data in real life poses challenges with respect to
                            performance, methodology and reusability. R is well known for its
                            succinct syntax for analytic tasks as well as plethora of tools for
                            data analysis and visualization, but it is not always associated with
                            scalability. In this talk we will present a scalable environment that
                            allows the use of R (and other languages) in a collaborative setting,
                            enabling sharing, reusability and reproducibility. In addition, it
                            opens new possibilities for visualization and interactive graphics by
                            providing seamless integration of JavaScript and R. Finally, the
                            distributed nature of the design allows us to provide R tools that
                            allow out-of-core data processing interfacing different back-ends
                            including Hadoop without sacrificing the ease of use of R. We will
                            also show a flexible framework for developing distributed models in R
                            while re-using as much of existing work as possible. As part of this
                            talk we will illustrate the use of those tools on real data sets,
                            including interactive visualization and distributed computing.

                            since. In this talk, I'll tell you a little bit about what I've been
                            working on instead (data ingest, purrr, multiple models, ...) and tell
                            you my plans for the future of ggvis. The goal is for 2016 to be the
                            year of ggvis, and I'm going to be putting a lot of time into ggvis
                            until it's a clear replacement for ggplot2.  I'll talk about some of
                            the new packages that will make this possible (including ggstat,
                            ggeom, and gglayout), and how this work is also going to improve
                            ggplot2.

                            We consider the problem of fitting a regression model that is both
                            flexible and interpretable. We propose two procedures for this task:
                            the Fused Lasso Additive Model (FLAM), which is an additive model of
                            piecewise constant fits; and Convex Regression with Interpretable
                            Sharp Partitions (CRISP), which extends FLAM to allow for
                            non-additivity. Both FLAM and CRISP are the solutions to convex
                            optimization problems that can be efficiently solved. We show that
                            FLAM and CRISP outperform competitors, such as sparse additive models
                            (Ravikumar et al, 2009), CART (Breiman et al, 1984), and thin plate
                            splines (Duchon, 1977), in a range of settings. We propose unbiased
                            estimators for the degrees of freedom of FLAM and CRISP, which allow
                            us to characterize their complexity.
