		      Attendees can use a small meeting room as a
		      health room. This room is located on the first
		      floor across from the Business Center. Please
		      enquire at the front desk and you will be
		      directed to it. There is also a staff
		      refrigerator for storing a few items. We
		      recommend that the items be clearly labelled
		      with names so as to avoid confusion.

		      The conference is over capacity at this point
		      and there's no waitlist possible. Please also
		      note that no registration is possible onsite
		      now. Parts of the conference will be streamed
		      online. Please visit the conference web page
		      periodically to get the details we post as they

                        useR! 2016 kicks off June 27, 2016. There will
                        be tutorials on 27th, which are free for all
                        registrants. Although the final schedule is

                    <h3>Are all the tutorials going to be on 27th June?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        All tutorials will be on the 27th.  Each tutorial lasts for 3 hours with a short break in between, starting around 10 a.m. and ending around 5 or 5:30 p.m., tentatively.

                    <h3>What parts of the conference will be streamed/recorded?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                      The plan is to use world-wide content delivery
                      networks (CDNs) to stream the keynote
                      sessions. We also plan to
                      record videos of the parallel sessions where
                      permissions are granted. The recorded material
                      will be released under
                      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license">Creative

                    <blockquote>
                        We would ask that you register as an industry participant. This enables us to keep costs down for full-time students.

                        Attendees who are driving to campus should park in the Galvez Parking Lot. Please see the map for the 3 entry points to the Galvez lot and its location relative to the
                        Arrillaga Alumni Center, where the conference will be held. Attendees will need to pay for parking using exact Cash, Coin, or Visa/MasterCard.  Parking is currently $8 per day
                        using a coupon code (code TBA).<br><br>
There are additional parking lots available on campus, but you will not be able to use the coupon code unless you park in the Galvez lot. Hourly payment is also available. No payment is required after
4pm.<br><br>
Please review the Alumni Center Parking Map for directions and additional parking options:

                    <h3>The conference is full now but Iâ€™d really like to register. What can I do about this?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        Due to a surge in registrations, the conference filled up before the early registration deadline. We did not anticipate this rush in bookings, our waitlist is now full and there is little else we can do at this stage. We regret the inconvenience caused, and hope you will join us next year.

                    <h3>I applied for a Diversity Scholarship. When can I expect to hear back?</h3>
