                    <h2>FAQs Regarding Registration/Attendance</h2>

		    <h3>What is the streaming URL for the Keynotes?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
		      Thanks to a generous offer
		      from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft
		      Corporation</a>, arrangements have been made to stream
		      the keynote talks
		      from <a href="https://aka.ms/user2016conference">https://aka.ms/user2016conference</a>. Video
		      recordings of the other sessions (where
		      permitted by speakers) will be made available in
		      due course using
		      a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs
			3.0 Unported</a> license.
		    </blockquote>
                    <h3>Are all the tutorials going to be on 27th June?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                      Yes. See <a href="http://schedule.user2016.org">http://schedule.user2016.org</a>
                      for details.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Do I need to register for tutorials?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                      Generally speaking, the tutorials are free to
                      those RSVP'd during registration. However, we
                      expect that not everyone will be able to attend
                      the tutorials of their choice due to room
                      capacity. So it will be mostly on a first come,
                      first served basis.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>I see people building their schedules
                    online. Do I have to do that to guarantee a spot
                    for a talk/tutorial?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                      Attendees are free to make up their schedules
                      online just as you would be able to using pencil
                      and paper although less efficiently. So while a
                      schedule might help you plan what you want to
                      attend, we can provide no guarantees because the
                      room capacities and fire codes have to be
                      respected.
                    </blockquote>

		    <h3>It seems registration is closed. Is there a waitlist?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
		      The conference is over capacity at this point
		      and there's no waitlist possible. Please also
		      note that no registration is possible onsite
		      either. See above for streaming options. Video
		      recordings of sessions (where permitted) will be
		      made available on
		      Microsoft's<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/">
		      Channel 9</a> as well as YouTube under the
		      license noted above.

                    <h3>Is there a refund policy for the registration fee?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        Please refer to the cancellation policy in your receipt. It is also stated at the bottom of registration landing page.

                    <h3>What is the parking at Stanford like? Can I drive my car to the conference?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        Attendees who are driving to campus should park in the Galvez Parking Lot. Please see the map for the 3 entry points to the Galvez lot and its location relative to the

                        using a coupon code (code TBA).
There are additional parking lots available on campus, but you will not be able to use the coupon code unless you park in the Galvez lot. Hourly payment is also available. No payment is required after
4pm.

		      Attendees can use a small meeting room as a

		      floor across from the Business Center. Please
		      enquire at the front desk and you will be
		      directed to it. There is also a staff
		      refrigerator for storing a few items. We

                    <h2>FAQs Regarding useR! 2016 Talks</h2>

                    <h3>What format do you suggest for my slides: 16:9
                    or 4:3? What projection capabilities are in each room?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
		      Depending on where your talk has been scheduled,
		      we recommend you choose the appropriate
		      format. McCaw Hall, SIEPR 130, and Wallenberg
		      124 work best with 16:9 format. All other rooms
		      use the standard 4:3 format. Using the standard
		      format in McCaw is likely to result in black
		      borders along the side. More details can be
		      found
		      on <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14336/latex-beamer-presentation-package-169-aspect-ratio">stackoverflow</a>

                    <h3>Can I use my own laptop for my talk?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
		      Each room has a Macbook pro available with
		      up-to-date versions of Powerpoint, Keynote and
		      Adobe PDF viewers. Lightning talks will have to
		      be preloaded on this machine. For other oral
		      presentations, you are free to use your laptop
		      in consultation with the session moderator.

		    <h3>Do I need to bring an adapter for use with my laptop?</h3>

		      No, we have all the standard adapters.

                    <h2>FAQs Regarding useR! 2016 Videotaping</h2>

                    <h3>What is the 2016 Video Recording Permission survey about?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        There are many more people who wish to attend the useR! 2016 conference than the conference can hold (all of the registrations were sold within 2 weeks of the conference announcement). For those that weren’t able to attend in person, Microsoft has generously provided funds and personnel to live-stream and/or record some presentations, and make recordings freely available to the R user community to share under a Creative Commons license.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Why are useR! speakers being asked to sign a “Permission to Use” waiver?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        Any time a presentation is videotaped or recorded at a conference it is important to establish what rights the speakers, conference organizers and third parties may have regarding the recorded material, and what liabilities, if any, they may assume. The Permission to Use waiver grants Microsoft (on behalf of the useR!2016 organizing committee) the right to record your presentation and share it (and allow others to share it) under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported</a> license.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>What legal document governs the rights and use of useR!2016 recorded material?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        Presentations videotaped at useR!2016 will be governed by the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported</a> license. This is a non-commercial license which, among other things, prohibits anyone from charging for the recorded material. This is a commonly-used license for creative works, which allows anyone to copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format under the following terms:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. </li>
                            <li>NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.  </li>
                            <li>NoDerivatives — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material. 	</li>

                    <h3>Will I receive a copy of my presentation video?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        Yes. After the conference, Microsoft will make the videotaped recordings available on <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> where they may be viewed or downloaded. You (and anyone else) may share the video in any medium according as allowed by the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported</a> license.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Am I giving up any rights to my presentation (slides, etc.)?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        No. You retain all rights (including copyright) to your content. By agreeing to the waiver, you are allowing for this video of your presentation to be shared as described above.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>What if I don’t agree to the “Permission to Use” waiver?</h3>
                    <blockquote>
                        If you don’t agree to the terms of the Permission to Use waiver, or simply do not want your presentation to be shared, simply respond “No” to the “Permission to Use” survey. If you are a keynote presenter, your presentation will not be livestreamed, and your presentation video will be erased and won’t be shared in any medium.
