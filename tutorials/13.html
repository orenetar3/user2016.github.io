                    <h3>Tutorial Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        An interactive graphic invites the viewer to become an active partner in the analysis and allows for
                        immediate feedback on how the data and results may change when inputs are modified. Interactive
                        graphics can be extremely useful for exploratory data analysis, for teaching, and for reporting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because there are so many different kinds of interactive graphics, there has been an explosion
                        in R packages that can produce them (e.g. animint, shiny, rCharts, rMaps, ggvis, htmlwidgets).
                        A beginner with little knowledge of interactive graphics can thus be easily confused by (1) understanding
                        what kinds of graphics are useful for what kinds of data, and (2) finding an R package that
                        can produce the desired type of graphic. This tutorial solves these two problems by (1) introducing
                        a vocabulary of keywords for understanding the different kinds of graphics, and (2) explaining what
                        R packages can be used for each kind of graphic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Attendees will gain hands-on experience with using R to create interactive graphics. We will discuss
                        several example data sets and several R interactive graphics packages. Attendees will learn a
                        vocabulary that helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the many different packages
                        which are currently available.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Explain and emphasize the role that interactive graphics have in reporting, scientific journals,

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By showing several examples, explain different categories of graphics: animated, multi-panel,
                            and multi-layer, interactive (direct vs indirect manipulation).
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Explain the strengths and weaknesses of the existing R packages, to highlight directions for
                            future work.

                    <p><i>A vocabulary for understanding interactive graphics, 30 minutes</i></p>
                    <p>
                        In this section we will give a high-level introduction about interactive graphics, without going into
                        details about R code for specific packages.
                    </p>
                    <p>Motivation: interactive graphics in exploratory data analysis, reporting results and teaching.</p>
                    <p>Vocabulary for describing interactive graphics:</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        <b>interactive</b> user interaction changes what is displayed. Useful when there are many similar plots
                        for different data subsets, but you don’t want to see them all at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>direct manipulation</b> interacting with plot elements (lines, points, etc).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>indirect manipulation</b> interacting with keyboard, mouse clicks on widgets (buttons, menus,
                        etc).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>animated</b> An animated graphic automatically advances over time, like a video. Animated graphics
                        are most useful when data sets have a time dimension. The only interaction possible is moving
                        forward and backward in time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>multi-layer</b> A multi-layer graphic uses several geometric elements to show several data sets and/or
                        variables. Multi-layer plots are useful for showing relationships between data sets and/or
                        variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>multi-panel</b> A multi-panel graphic shows different things in different panels (sub-plots) which each
                        have their own axes (perhaps different from each other). Useful when there are many similar
                        plots for different data subsets, and you <b>do</b> want to see them at the same time. Also useful
                        for showing different plots with aligned axes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Compare and contrast:</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>interactive vs animated</b> only interaction possible in an animated graphic is moving forward and
                        backward in time (animated graphics are thus a subset of interactive graphics).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>interactive vs multi-panel</b> both useful for many similar plots with different data subsets. Do
                        you want to see all the subsets at the same time? (yes=multi-panel, no=interactive)
                    </p>

                    <p><i>Quiz questions</i></p>
                    <p>
                        The previous section introduced a vocabulary for describing interactive graphics. In the following
                        section, after showing a new graphic, we will ask the audience to take 1 minute to discuss with their
                        neighbour about which vocabulary words can be used to describe that graphic.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Background Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since we plan to present state-of-the-art interactive graphics, people should know how to use R data
                        structures (lists, data.frames) and the ggplot2 package.<br /><br />
                        Even though many examples will be interactive web graphics, we will assume only knowledge of
                        R, not HTML/JavaScript.<br /><br />
                        There are two classes of potential attendees:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                UseRs who are not very familiar with interactive graphics should benefit the most, since we
                                will give a high-level overview of many different packages.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                DevelopeRs of interactive packages are encouraged to come, to discuss the current state-ofthe-
                                art and future directions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
